This question practices the use of a list method. Assign to the variable grades a list of 10 letter grades
from among 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'F'. For example:
grades = ['A', 'F', 'C', 'F', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'A', 'B']
Write a Python expression that creates a list named frequency, in which the elements are the number
of times each of the letters A, B, C, D and F appear in grades. For example, for the above value of
grades, the following would be correct output:
frequency = [4, 2, 2, 0, 2]
Your expression must give the correct values for any list of grades, not just the one in your list. Hint:
use the list method count.
2. This question practices list membership, list indexes and list slices.
a. Write a Python statement that creates a list named dog_breeds that contains the elements
'collie', 'sheepdog', 'Chow', and 'Chihuahua' in the order given.
b. Write a Python statement that uses list slicing to create a list herding_dogs that is made up of
the first two elements of dog_breeds.
c. Write a Python statement that uses list indexing to create a list tiny_dogs that is made up of
the last element of dog_breeds.
d. Write a Python statement that tests whether 'Persian' is in the list dog_breeds and prints
either True or False depending on the answer.
