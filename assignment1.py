Exercise 1.1

1.In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?
Answer: you will receive an error when trying to run the code. 
2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks,
or both?
Answer:  you will receive an error when trying to run the code
3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus
sign before a number? What about 2++2?

Exercise 1.2. Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.
1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.
3. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per
mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?

Exercise 2.1. Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn a new feature,
you should try it out in interactive mode and make errors on purpose to see what goes wrong. • We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?
How about x = y = 1?
• In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a
semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
• What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
• In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?

Exercise 2.2. Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:
1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 43 πr3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?
2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
