Problem 3
A radar speed gun is a device used in law-enforcement to measure the speed of moving vehicles in miles
per hour. The measured speeds are supposed to be stored in a file, one number per line, as follows:
65.6
70.2
54.9
Unfortunately, due to an intermittent fault, occasionally multiple numbers are written on a single line as
follows:
73.2 65.6 69.8
Furthermore, occasionally the radar gun outputs a single stray character such as: 67.9z, 6$4.9, or a3.9, to
illustrate just a few.
Given a file that has radar speed gun readings, write a function
averageSpeed() to calculate the average of
the numbers in the file. Your code must adhere to the following specifications:
a. Prompt the user for the name of the input file to process. When the user enters a nonexistent file
name, give the user a second chance. After two wrong entries in a row, quit the program with an
appropriate message.
b. Ignore numbers containing stray characters.
c. Ignore any reading for slow vehicles moving at 2 miles per hour or less.
d. Print the final average to the console.
e. Make use of the functions
safeOpen() and
safeFloat().
For example, the following is correct input/output:
>>> inputFile = open('radar.txt')
>>> content = inputFile.read()
>>> print(content)
35.2
1.8
65.6
67.9z
70.2
73.2 a3.9 65.6 69.8
6$4.9
54.9
>>> inputFile.close()
>>>
>>> averageSpeed()
Enter file name: ghost.txt
File not found. Please try again.
Enter file name: phantom.txt
File not found. Yet another human error. Goodbye.
>>>
>>> averageSpeed()
>>> Enter file name: radar.txt
>>> Average speed is 62.07 miles per hour.
