Problem 1
Write a class definition line and a one line docstring for the class

__init__ method for the
class
Dog that gives each dog its own
name and
breed. Test this on a successful creation of a
Dog object.
>>> import dog
>>> sugar = dog.Dog('Sugar', 'border collie')
>>> sugar.name
'Sugar'
>>> sugar.breed
'border collie'
Problem 2
Add a data attribute
tricks of type
list to each
Dog instance and initialize it in
__init__ to the empty list. The
user does not have to supply a list of tricks when constructing a
Dog instance. Make sure that you test this
successfully.
